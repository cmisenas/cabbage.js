Cabbage.js
==========

Cabbage.js (from canvas + image, getit, gettit, no??) is a lightweight library for manipulating an HTML5 canvas.

HTML5 canvas stores image data as a 1-dimensional array with a pixel being four consecutive array elements (r, g, b and a);

With cabbage, simply pass the canvas element and refer to the pixel using x and y coordinates. You don't have to keep track of which pixel and value type you are on.
